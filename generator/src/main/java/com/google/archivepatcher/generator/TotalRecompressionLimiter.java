/**
 * Limits the total amount of recompression to be performed as part of a patch via the {@link
 * PreDiffPlanEntryModifier} interface.
 *
 * <p>This class is useful for helping to establish an upper bound on the amount of work that needs
 * to be done to apply a patch. For example, if the patch is to be applied on a device that can
 * recompress at about 100K/sec and the desire is to keep recompression time to 10 seconds or less,
 * an upper bound of 1000K would be appropriate.
 *
 * <p>Please note that there are many factors involved in the total patch-apply time including, but
 * not limited to, things like the I/O speed of the device applying the patch and the time that is
 * required to apply the delta to the uncompressed content prior to recompressing.
 *
 * <p>This class implements the following algorithm:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Identify all of the {@link PreDiffPlanEntry}s that have {@link
 *       ZipEntryUncompressionOption#uncompressNewEntry} set to <code>true</code>. These identify
 *       all the entries that have changed and that require recompression.
 *   <li>Sort those {@link PreDiffPlanEntry}s in order of decreasing uncompressed size.
 *   <li>Iterate over the list in order. For each entry, if the uncompressed size is less than the
 *       number of uncompressed bytes remaining before hitting the cap, retain it; else, discard it.
 *   <li>Return the resulting list of the retained entries. Note that the order of this list may not
 *       be the same as the input order (i.e., it has been sorted in order of decreasing compressed
 *       size).
 * </ol>
 *
 * This algorithm attempts to preserve the largest changed resources needing recompression, assuming
 * that these are the most likely to be delta-friendly and therefore represent the best patch size
 * savings. This may not be true in <em>all cases</em> but is likely in practice.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this algorithm does <em>not</em> limit the size of the temporary files needed
 * to apply a patch. In particular it does <em>not</em> limit the size of the "delta-friendly old
 * blob" that is generated during the patch-apply step, since that blob may contain an arbitrary
 * amount of compressed resources that are not considered here. To limit the size of the
 * delta-friendly old blob, use a {@link DeltaFriendlyOldBlobSizeLimiter}.
